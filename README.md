# TestVargant_CricketTeam_Coding_Challenge
This code will provide you the filtered teams based on the n consecutive wins/losses of a particular team.
I have made this project using java programming language.
In this, I have made an array of objects named "teams" to store the the data of cricket teams.
And then, this program will filter teams according to the "n" number of consecutive losses/wins and will find the average points of filtered teams.
If you want to run this code on command promt, which I recommend you to do, then please follow this procedure:
1. Save this code on Desktop with name CricketTeam_Challenge.
2. Then write "cd Desktop".
3. Then write "javac CricketTeam_Challenge.java" to compile the program, you need to compile it only once.
4. Then write "java CricketTeam_Challenge" to execute the program.
5. You need to enter "java CricketTeam_Challenge" everytime to execute this program in command prompt.
You can also use other java programming applications to execute this program, if you want to.
After the program has been executed, you have to enter in which type you want to filter the teams, means either you want to filter them according to the number of consecutive losses or wins. So please enter either "loss" or "win" in the input.
And then click enter.
Then, you have to enter the value of "n", that is the number of consecutive losses or wins to filter the data, so please enter the number: 2,3,4,etc..
And after that just click enter again.
In results, you will get the names of filtered teams and the avearge points of these filtered teams.
